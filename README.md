# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts the presence of heart disease in a patient using various machine learning algorithms. It uses patient health metrics and clinical parameters to classify whether a person is likely to have heart disease. The primary goal is to support early diagnosis and treatment.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository - Heart Disease Dataset
- **Attributes Used:** Age, Gender, Chest Pain Type, Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar, ECG Results, Max Heart Rate, Exercise Induced Angina, Oldpeak, ST Slope, etc.
- **Target:** 1 (presence), 0 (absence) of heart disease

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
